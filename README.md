# Code Quiz 

This web application quizzes students and job applicants on their knowledge of JavaScript fundamentals. With a built-in local storage feature, it is also a great way of comparing the user's progress against peers.

Special attention was given to Web API functionality to enhance application interactivity.

## Contributions

Questions and answer choices were received from UNC Bootcamp's example of this project.

Assistance was provided by Learning Assistant Rudie at AskBCS in pushing the user's score to a potentially empty array in local storage.
